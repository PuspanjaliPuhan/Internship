                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (1931 - 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
                    statesman
                    who served as India's 11th president from 2002 to 2007. He was born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and
                    studied physics and aerospace engineering. Kalam is known as the "Missile Man" for his role in
                    India's missile technology, designing the Agni and Prithvi ballistic missiles, and developing
                    India's first indigenous satellite launch vehicle, the SLV-III. He also helped establish India as a
                    nuclear power, oversaw the development of several indigenous missiles, and played a key role in
                    increasing cooperation between India and Russia in the field of space research.
